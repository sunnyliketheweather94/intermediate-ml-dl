# Workshop Description
TODO(instructor): fill in this section with a description of your workshop.

This course covers the following aspects:
  * Inductive Biases of Deep Learning Approaches
  * Data Augmentation
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  * Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  * Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning
  * Interpretability & Explainability for Deep Learning
  
<!-- It may be helpful to know that you can *italicize* text with single-asterisks
(or alternatively, using _underscores_),
and that you can **bold** text using double-asterisks.

If you want to insert a link, use `[` in order to delimit the text that you wish
to appear in the web-UI, and after closing the text with `]`insert the URL in a
set of `()`, e.g. [here is a link to ICME's
website](https://icme.stanford.edu/). -->

## About the Instructor

TODO(instructor): create a profile photo in two steps.

  * Replace "instructor-name" in the image below with your name (note: this link
is only visible in the raw-text file; on the web-page itself you'll simply see a
sticky note with "To Do" written on it).
  * Move the image you would like to appear on your website into the 
    following folder contained in your website's working directory
    ```
    /assets/img/profile.jpg
    ```
![instructor-name](/assets/img/profile.jpg){:style="max-width:30%;"}

TODO(instructor): insert a description about yourself here!

# Workshop Materials

## Pre-workshop Checklist
The workshop assumes that you have requisite knowledge of: 
  * Python programming 
  * NumPy
  * Basic understanding of Deep Learning
  * Some experience with coding your own deep learning models

For the purposes of this workshop, we assume that you have trained some deep learning models in the past. We shall be using PyTorch to illustrate the concepts of this workshop, and the coding exercises shall be in PyTorch as well. Users of Tensorflow/MxNet/Theano(RIP) are welcome to use those libraries and will receive assistance as the instructor is conversant in those.
<!-- TODO(instructor): enumerate what students need to take care of before the
workshop. E.g.

1. Download the following tools: ...
2. Familiarize with the schedule posted below. -->

## Schedule
TODO(instructor): Make sure the dates and times are accurate below for your
course. E.g. replace `?`'s with the hour (or time-of-day) 
that your course starts. Adjust time schedules within each session.

#### Session 1 (?:00 - ?: ?.M. PST)
  - Topic 1 with example time-allocation.
  - Topic 2 with example time-allocation, etc.
  - 15 minute Q&A
  
#### Session 2 (?:00 - ?:00 ?.M. PST)
  - Something similar as above.
