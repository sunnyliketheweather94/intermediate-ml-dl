# Intermediate Topics in Machine Learning and Deep Learning
## Workshop Description
Through a series of rapid surveys, we will present an overview of recent topics in deep learning and machine learning with particular relevance for practitioners. Areas will include biases in deep learning, data augmentation, generative modeling, GANs, MLE, uncertainty quantification for deep learning, and finally, interpretability and explainability of deep learning models. This workshop will assume a familiarity with basic concepts from both machine learning and deep learning as taught in the introductory workshops on those topics, but it will not assume a deep statistical background. Check the pre-workshop checklist below for more information.

This course covers the following aspects:
  * Inductive Biases of Deep Learning Approaches
  * Data Augmentation
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  * Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  * Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning
  * Interpretability & Explainability for Deep Learning

## Workshop Materials

### Pre-workshop Checklist
The workshop assumes that you have requisite knowledge of: 
  * Python programming 
  * NumPy
  * Basic understanding of Deep Learning
  * Some experience with coding your own deep learning models

For the purposes of this workshop, we assume that you have trained some deep learning models in the past. We shall be using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) to illustrate the concepts of this workshop, and the coding exercises shall be in PyTorch as well. Users of Tensorflow/MxNet/Theano(RIP) are welcome to use those libraries and will receive assistance as the instructor is conversant in those.
